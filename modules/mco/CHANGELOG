# Changelog

## 0.2.0
A whole new version of MCO which uses the 8-bit DAC.
Now it has two CV controls and a mode selector.
With these, we can feed it with multiple software implementations.
Current version is a UNISON oscillator.
It also comes with a simple analog low pass filter to smooth the DAC output.
